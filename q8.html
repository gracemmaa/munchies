                <h1>What happens if I mix weed and alcohol?</h1>

                <p>
                    Marijuana, which is derived from the cannabis plant, impacts certain areas of the
                    brain including the ones that are responsible for memory, sensory and time perception,
                    thinking and pleasure, among others. Alcohol is a depressant that affects the
                    central nervous system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When someone uses an alcohol and weed combination, they might start to notice they
                    feel the effects of one or both much more quickly than they would otherwise, and in
                    a more pronounced way. When people drink and then smoke weed afterward,
                    they have also been shown to have much higher amounts of THC in their blood as opposed
                    to people who didnâ€™t drink. The reason for this appears to be because alcohol widens
                    the blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing for the faster absorption of the THC.
